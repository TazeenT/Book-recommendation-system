# Book Recommendation System

A **Book Recommendation System** built using Python and data science techniques to suggest books based on user preferences and past reading history.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, similarity computation, and recommendation algorithms.

---

## Objective
- Recommend books to users using collaborative filtering and content-based methods
- Showcase data analysis and machine learning skills
- Build a small-scale, practical recommendation system

---

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## Features
- Suggest books based on user ratings or preferences
- Uses similarity measures like cosine similarity
- Notebook interface for easy experimentation

---

## Dataset (from Kaggle)

- This project uses a book ratings dataset available on Kaggle:
Book Recommendation Dataset (with users, books, ratings)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset

## Notes
- Built for educational and learning purposes.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle and not included in the repository.
- Uses collaborative filtering with cosine similarity.
- Recommendation accuracy depends on dataset size and sparsity.
